# Nodeschool Progress

This is just a compendium of my work through some nodeschool workshoppers.

The nodeschool project homepage is https://nodeschool.io.

## expressworks

5 Jan. 2017 - Completed all modules

## functional-javascript

31 Dec. 2016 - Completed through "Partial Application without Bind"

1 Jan. 2017 - Completed through "Implement map with Reduce"

5 Jan. 2017 - Completed through "Blocking Event Loop"

7 Jan. 2017 - Completed through "Recursion"

8 Jan. 2017 - Completed remaining modules

Definitely need to look deeper into functional concepts like trampolining and currying.

Overall, this has been far and away the most difficult workshop.
I guess doing functional programming more often might help me a lot.

This makes me wonder if I should learn Haskell.

## git-it

31 Dec. 2016 - Completed through "Repository"

31 Dec. 2016 - Completed remaining modules

Ended up altering the source code for the solution to "Githubbin."
Changed `git config user.username` to `git config user.name`.
See docs at https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#git-config-username.

Update: Submitted pull request to jlord/git-it with an update to that lesson.

Another update: `user.username` was intended to be a custom config property. Oops.

## how-to-markdown

24 Dec. 2016 - Completed all modules

(Just playing around with Markdown now.)

## how-to-npm

27 Dec. 2016 - Completed through "Login"

28 Dec. 2016 - Completed remaining modules

## learnyoumongo

27 Dec. 2016 - Completed "mongod"

29 Dec. 2016 - Completed remaining modules

Removed all files from the /learnyoumongo/data folder.
They collectively took up several gigabytes for some reason.
That may be indicative of a larger problem...

Or just MongoDB allocating a ton of unnecessary extra space.

## learnyounode
