# Nodeschool Progress

This is just a compendium of my work through some nodeschool workshoppers.

The nodeschool project homepage is https://nodeschool.io.

## git-it

Ended up altering the source code for the solution to "Githubbin."
Changed `git config user.username` to `git config user.name`.
See docs at https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#git-config-username.

Update: Submitted pull request to jlord/git-it with an update to that lesson.

Removed all files from the /learnyoumongo/data folder.

That may be indicative of a larger problem...
