# tower-of-babel status

9 Jan. 2017 - Completed through "Class"

10 Jan. 2017 - Completed remaining modules

Conclusions: ES6 has some nice new features, but I may or may not actually have a use for them yet.

Rest/spread certainly seems helpful.
I already use arrow functions quite often.
Same with block scoping.

Prototypical class structure never bothered me (especially with `Object.create()`), but I guess the ES6 classes have their benefits.
If nothing else, they'd be more familiar for users of other languages.

I'll probably have to look further into generators/iterator objects to find the full benefits of those.

Potentially sudo npm uninstall babel-cli -g after finishing this.
Pretty sure Node supports all of ES6 at this point.
