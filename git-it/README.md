# git-it Status

31 Dec. 2016 - Completed through "Repository"

31 Dec. 2016 - Completed remaining modules

Note: Altered Githubbin verification slightly.
Normal username field in `git config` appears to be `user.name` now, not `user.username`.
It's not hard to set `user.username` too, but it seems unneeded.

Anyway, sent in a pull request to jlord/git-it with the suggested change.
